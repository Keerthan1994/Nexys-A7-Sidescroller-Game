In order to properly run the mapit_coe file you must run it through a command prompt

cd into correct file path where mapit_coe exists - in this case:

C:\Users\ryanp\Documents\Grad-School\ECE-540-SoC-Progammable-Logic-FPGAs\Projects\BOTWorldDevKit_r3\BOTWorldDevKit_r3\newmaps

from there use the following command:

mapit_coe.pl <newmap.txt >newmap.coe

where newmap.txt is your world map file and newmap.coe is the init file for core generator
