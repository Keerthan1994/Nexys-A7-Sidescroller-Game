BOTWorldDevKit Readme file for Revision 4.0
(Last updated 23-May-2015)
--------------------------------------------

BOTWorld Development Kit for the Digilent Nexys4 and Vivado.  Updated documentation and cleaned up the directories since
Xilinx replaced the ISE Core Generator with the similar, but different) Block Memory Generator

NOTE:  I have successfully synthesized and implemented a Rojobot 3.1 system using the Vivado flow documented in this
package.  But, I have not run the system.  Please report any problem to Roy Kravitz.  If possible provide an
example projectthat I can build/run to identify and fix the problem.
